Thank you for being one of the few people to intentionally look for information about "Rory Roberts".

I am in my twenties, I went to the university of Hull and accidentally stayed in Hull for career reasons too. I like it here. I spend a lot of time at work writing software and a lot at home learning new dev stuff and reading lots of opinions about development. There's too many opinions, so sometimes I play the bass instead or bake a loaf of bread.
